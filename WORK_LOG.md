| April 5    |   9-10pm   |                                                                                                                            I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| October 9  | 9:00-9:30  | Start planning on how I might tackle issue look at past ways we've interacted through loops, and checks out collections class remebering it had someintresting things |
| October 9  | 9:30-10:00 |                                                              Can't figure out a fast way of doing set, so just start coding a way to traverse the string interatively |
| October 10 | 2-2:40 pm  |                                                                     Finished making a protype intarative way of solving the problem set, but it's very very very slow |
| October 13 |   5:30-6   |                                                      Started thinking of how to treat letters as number since Mr. Blick said that number is O(1) while words are 0(n) |
| October 13 |  9:30-10   |                                                                          Continue to try and figure out how to not have 0(n) runtime but can't think of anything good |
